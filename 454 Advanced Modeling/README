This advanced modeling course is divided into two major sections. The first section concerns theory and application of stochastic processes, including Markov processes. 
The second section concerns Bayesian statistics, including Bayesian belief modeling. Throughout the course, students explore applied probability models that represent business 
processes in graphs or networks. Students execute simulation experiments, both discrete-Â­event and process simulations. This is a case study and project-based course with an 
extensive programming component.
