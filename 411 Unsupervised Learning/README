This course introduces data modeling for studies in which there is no clear distinction between explanatory and response variables. The objective may be to explain relationships
among many continuous variables in terms of underlying dimensions, latent variables, or factors, as with principal components and factor analysis. The objective may be to find a 
lower-dimensional representation for multivariate cross-classified data, as with log-linear models. The objective may be to construct a visualization of variables or objects, as 
with traditional multidimensional scaling and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Or the objective may be to identify groups of variables and/or objects that are similar
to one another, as with cluster analysis and biclustering. Students work on research and programming assignments, exploring multivariate data and methods.
