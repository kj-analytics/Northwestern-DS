This course provides an overview of the discipline of data engineering. It introduces software and systems for data science and software development as required in the design 
of data-intensive applications. Students learn about algorithms, data structures, and technologies or storing and processing data. Students gain experience with open-source 
software, text editors, and integrated development environments. Students employ best practices in software development, utilizing tools for syntax checking, testing, debugging, 
and version control. The course also introduces formal models, simulations, and benchmark experiments for evaluating software, systems, and processes.
