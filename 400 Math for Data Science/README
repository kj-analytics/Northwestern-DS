Students learn techniques for building and interpreting mathematical models of real-world phenomena in and across multiple disciplines, including linear algebra, 
discrete mathematics, probability, and calculus, with an emphasis on applications in data science and data engineering. This is for students who want a firm understanding 
or review of these fields of mathematics prior to enrolling in courses that assume understanding of mathematical concepts.
